# Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my **Professional Portfolio**.  
This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my experience designing and implementing **scalable, maintainable, and production-grade systems**.  

Each project is organized in its own directory, with documentation, architecture diagrams, and code samples where applicable.

## üìÇ Portfolio Contents

- **[CDR Processing & BI System](./cdr-processing-system/)**  
  A full ETL and reporting system that ingests telecom CDRs (binary/plain text), consolidates them in a MySQL cluster, and provides near real-time analytics through a BI module and reporting engine.  

- **Project 2 (Example: Microservices Platform)**  
  A microservices-based architecture for a distributed application using Docker, Kubernetes, and REST APIs.  

- **Project 3 (Example: Event-Driven System)**  
  An event-driven system using Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing.  

*(More projects will be added to showcase different areas such as cloud-native applications, big data pipelines, and enterprise integration patterns.)*

## üìê Architecture Focus

Each project highlights:

- **System context & requirements**
- **High-level architecture diagrams (C4 model)**
- **Container & component-level designs**
- **Technology stack and design decisions**
- **Implementation notes (code samples, scripts, configuration)**
