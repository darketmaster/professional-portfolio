# Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my **Professional Portfolio**.  
This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my experience designing and implementing **scalable, maintainable, and production-grade systems**.  

Each project is organized in its own directory, with documentation, architecture diagrams, and code samples where applicable.

## üìÇ Portfolio Contents

- **[CDR Processing & BI System](./cdr-processing-system/)**  
  A full ETL and reporting system that ingests telecom CDRs (binary/plain text), consolidates them in a MySQL cluster, and provides near real-time analytics through a BI module and reporting engine.  


- **[OSS/BSS Mediation & Provisioning System (Multi-vendor)](./cdr-processing-system/)** 

  This project showcases a **telecom-grade OSS (Operational Support System)** integrated with BSS and customer management platforms, designed to streamline provisioning, monitoring, and support in multi-vendor environments.  
  The system provides **agnostic support for heterogeneous access devices (DSLAM, OLT, ONT, CPE, switches)** and leverages automation to deliver **faster service activation, unified monitoring, and improved troubleshooting efficiency**.  
  
  Through this platform, operational teams achieved:  
  - Over **80% reduction in provisioning time** via one-click and zero-touch automation.  
  - Over **70% reduction in diagnostic and support times** through unified monitoring and historical data.  
  - **Consolidation of support tools** into a single platform for Level 1 to Level 3 operations.

## üìê Architecture Focus

Each project highlights:

- **System context & requirements**
- **High-level architecture diagrams (C4 model)**
- **Container & component-level designs**
- **Technology stack and design decisions**
- **Implementation notes (code samples, scripts, configuration)**

## üîß Tools & Technologies

Some of the technologies and tools you will find across the projects:

- **Languages**: Java, PHP, JavaScript, Bash, Python, C#, C/C++, Perl 
- **Databases**: MySQL, Data Warehouse, NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)  
- **ETL & Data Processing**: Custom pipelines, Kafka, Spark  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD  
- **Architecture Modeling**: PlantUML (C4 diagrams), Markdown, UML
